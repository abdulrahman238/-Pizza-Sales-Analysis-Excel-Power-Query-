# Recomended Analysis

This project looks at a year’s worth of pizza sales to answer key business questions:

How many customers order each day, and what are the peak hours?

How many pizzas are typically in an order, and which pizzas sell the most?

How much revenue did the business make each month, and are there seasonal trends?

Which pizzas might be removed from the menu, and which could be promoted?
