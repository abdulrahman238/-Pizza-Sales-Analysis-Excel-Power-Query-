# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Excel-Power-Query-
Analyzed a year’s worth of pizza sales to understand our customers better. Using Excel Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the data without writing any formulas.

# Recommended Analysis

This project looks at a year’s worth of pizza sales to answer key business questions:

- How many customers order each day, and what are the peak hours?
- How many pizzas are typically in an order, and which pizzas sell the most?
- How much revenue did the business make each month, and are there seasonal trends?
- Which pizzas might be removed from the menu, and which could be promoted?
